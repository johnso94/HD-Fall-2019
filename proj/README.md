For my project, I added in two new features. The first one counts the total number of translations which the program has made and prints them in Summary. This code have a feature which adds 1 to a general register every time that the translate function changes out the old character for the new one. This general register is then called at the end with a results2P to be printed out. The second feature is one which counts the non-line characters which is what I originally thought characters should do. For this one I just moved words back to be printed in results2P and loaded r1-r2 into r3 so that that would be printed. The overall change from these features is two new additions to summary, one which gives the number of translations and another which gives the number of non-line characters. 

finalproj.s is where I stored the completed project with extra features
